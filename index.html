        <div class="introduction">
        	<p>The ocean, vast and mysterious, serves as a powerful symbol of the divine in many spiritual traditions. Its endless horizon reminds us of the infinite nature of the universe and the boundless presence of a higher power. Just as the waves rise and fall in a rhythm beyond our control, so too does life move according to a greater plan. Standing at the shore, one can feel a deep connection to something larger than oneself — a presence that calms the soul, awakens inner peace, and invites surrender. The ocean teaches humility, showing us how small we are in the face of such majesty, yet also how deeply we belong to the vast web of life.

				Spiritually, the ocean can be seen as a mirror of the soul — deep, layered, and full of mystery. Its surface may be calm or stormy, just like our emotions, but beneath, there is always stillness and depth. Many find healing by simply being near the sea, letting the salty breeze cleanse their thoughts and the rhythmic waves wash away their burdens. The ocean calls us to return to our true selves, to embrace silence and listen deeply. In its presence, we are reminded that, like water, the spirit flows — adapting, enduring, and always seeking unity with the source from which all life springs.</p>

                <p>“There was a magic about the sea. People were drawn to it. People wanted to love by it, swim in it, play in it, look at it. It was a living thing that was as unpredictable as a great stage actor: it could be calm and welcoming, opening its arms to embrace it’s audience one moment, but then could explode with its stormy tempers.”</p>

                <br>
                <p>“There’s nothing wrong with enjoying looking at the surface of the ocean itself, except that when you finally see what goes on underwater, you realize that you’ve been missing the whole point of the ocean. Staying on the surface all the time is like going to the circus and staring at the outside of the tent.”</p>

                <p>“The deep roar of the ocean. The break of waves on farther shores that thought can find. The silent thunders of the deep. And from among it, voices calling, and yet not voices, humming trillings, wordlings, and half-articulated songs of thought.”</p>
